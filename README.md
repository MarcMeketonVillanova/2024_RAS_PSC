# Optimize Switching in a Flat Rail Yard

**Executive Summary**
Switching wagons in large flat yards is arguably one of the most complex daily actions a railway performs.  Doing it efficiently on a limited number of tracks of varying sizes while building many train-blocks takes skill and experience.
Little has been done to develop algorithms to assist engineers and conductors that have to figure out the sequence of steps to take to properly and efficiently sort a set of wagons .
The goal of this problem solving competition is to build open-source software and algorithms that can plan out the sequence of moves required to sort.
